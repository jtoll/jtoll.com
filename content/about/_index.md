# About James Toll
I’m a father and I currently work with a medical device start-up. Previously, I was an options market maker, and I occasionally teach [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)) trading techniques to individuals. I do a fair amount of quantitative analysis, typically in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/), but it’s [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) that I find most intriguing. I also dabble in photography and design.
